# Mental-stress-level-prediction-using-machine-learning-models
The proposed project aims to build machine learning algorithms which detect the stress level of people by analyzing their behavior in different aspects of their life from the data set which was collected from different peoples.These algorithms can identify,when an individual may struggle with stress and suggest some solutions to them. We projected the system for stress prediction of people based on the  Random Forest and decision tree algorithm and accuracy,precision,recall and f1score is used as a evaluation parameter.The data set consists of 18 different attributes on which different machine model will be deployed and the performance of the model can be analyzed with the help of  accuracy.The random forest model has predicated the mental stress level with an highest accuracy of  62.7% among all the models.
